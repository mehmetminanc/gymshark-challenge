Here is some more work that should be done, I don't think it's humanely possible to do all these in 48h.

## Infra
- [ ] Integrate CloudFront for static assets, this also provides SSL
- [ ] Get a fancy domain name, e.g. `wefullfilorders.com`
- [ ] Revisit CORS rules and headers with a production setup
- [ ] Lack of CI/CD is disturbing 

## Backend
- [ ] Add Integration tests, this should be easy with SAM
- [ ] Cache DP table to be reused across calls
- [ ] Do more tests for the handler

## UI
- [ ] Use a frontend framework for the app. Last time I checked `react` was the hype - it has been some time.
- [ ] Set up unit tests.
- [ ] Set up E2E tests.
